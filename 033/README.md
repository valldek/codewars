# ![6kyu badge](../.codewars-badges/6kyu.png) Write Number in Expanded Form - Part 2

This is version 2 of my ['Write Number in Exanded Form' Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/write-number-in-expanded-form).

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathplacementreview.com/arithmetic/decimals.php#writing-a-decimal-in-expanded-form). For example:

```javascript
expandedForm(1.24); // should return '1 + 2/10 + 4/100'
expandedForm(7.304); // should return '7 + 3/10 + 4/1000'
expandedForm(0.04); // should return '4/100'
```
